## Coding Standards

### General Guidelines

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow the existing code style and patterns
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Write self-documenting code with appropriate comments

### TypeScript/JavaScript Style

- We use ESLint and Prettier for code formatting
- Run `npm run lint` before submitting your code
- Fix any linting errors before submitting a PR

### React Best Practices

- Use functional components with hooks
- Keep components small and focused on a single responsibility
- Use the Context API for state that needs to be shared across components
- Avoid prop drilling by using context or composition

### CSS/Styling

- We use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Follow the existing design system and component patterns
- Use the provided UI components from our component library

## Testing

We encourage writing tests for new features. While we don't currently have a formal testing setup, we plan to add one in the future.

## Documentation

- Update documentation when you change functionality
- Document new components with JSDoc comments
- Add comments to explain complex logic

## Adding New Features

When adding new features, consider the following:

1. Is this feature aligned with the project's goals?
2. Does it follow our design principles?
3. Is it well-tested and documented?
4. Does it maintain backward compatibility?
